# neural-networks-benzene-estimation
Machine learning pipeline for time-series regression on air quality sensor data. The repository covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and systematic evaluation of neural network models (MLP, CNN, LSTM/GRU) for benzene concentration prediction, with a focus on reproducible experiments and efficient hyperparameter analysis.
