# neural-networks-benzene-estimation
This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for time-series regression based on air quality sensor data. The work focuses on the design, implementation, and systematic evaluation of neural network models for predicting benzene (C₆H₆) concentration from multisensor measurements.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, sequence construction, and extensive experimental analysis of multiple neural architectures, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU). Model performance is assessed using reproducible experimental protocols, controlled hyperparameter studies, and robust evaluation metrics.

Special attention is given to computational efficiency, experiment reproducibility, and scalable evaluation strategies, such as one-at-a-time and grid-based hyperparameter analysis. The repository is structured to support both scientific experimentation and practical application in environmental monitoring systems.
